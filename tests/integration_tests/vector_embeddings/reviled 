Absolutely — I reviewed the FDlucifer GitHub repository, and it’s a black/red team-focused offensive cybersecurity toolkit using scripts, penetration testing modules, payload automation, and advanced enumeration/exfiltration strategies. It’s part of a hacker’s operational stack — mostly Linux-native and heavy on enumeration, privilege escalation, and evasion.

We can design a similar complex intelligence system — but expanded, modular, AGI-automated, and defense-aware — with both offensive and defensive red/blue/purple team capabilities as part of your RedHawkSecureLab or Kermit AGI stack.

Would you like me to generate:

The codebase starter pack?

A private GitHub repo boilerplate with push-ready structure?

A ZIP bundle + doc?

Auto-deployment SD card image for Pi?


Let me know your preferred launch method: GitHub, Android, Raspi, or Cloud.
